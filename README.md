Question1: File Handling Program
========

## Get Started
make sure you have installed Linux system on your Laptop
To run the **File Handling C program** type these commands one after another in your terminal inside the directory of the project:
```bash
$ gcc Question1.c
```
then
```
$ ./a.out
```

## Overview of the Topic 

In this program, we basically gonna see how to read an existing file (File.txt) 

If the file is Null, Then it can not read nothing inside, else the file can open 
then we start the program


## The Algorithm

My Algorithm has only one function which is the **main()** function:
=========

by openning the file**open()**
By Cheking if the file eixt or not 
once it is verified that the file exist it wil be openned and reading the content.
else the the program should **exit()**


After that I used While method to check whether the the content should be converted to lowercase and eliminate the punctuation.
By checking this with while method

the file should **close()**.

using the **fork()** , it will divide relevant tasks between parent and child/children(ren) and then it will  print out all unique words from the file and their number of occurrences.



## The Output

Kindly, I higly recommend to check the screenshots  and then try this code on your system

**Then!!! This is for the Question1**





Question2:  Program that mimics a simple spreadsheet
========

## Get Started
make sure you have installed Linux system on your Laptop
To run the **Simple spreadsheet C program** type these commands one after another in your terminal inside the directory of the project:
```bash
$ gcc Q2.c
```
then
```
$ ./a.out
```


## The Case Study

The program is a simple spreadsheet with The maximum size of the spreadsheet is 5 x 5 cells
by reading the User input, the program should be excetued and the give answer if it is good or not

Let's what I got for the Algorithm





## The Algorithm

Here we got three functions:
=======

**if_number()** is checking if the input that user gave it is real number, it is controling all that
**main()** the main function is one which is take caring of the sheet  how it will be excuted by give a hand to the program
**program()** this function is reading the user input and checking whether is valid input or good. this function is givig evry information to **main()** to run the program and be able the valid output that the user request for.

Let's what we got in the Output


## The Output



Kindly, I higly recommend to check the screenshots  I upload on the github and then try this code on your system by the instructions I said at the beginning.

**Then!!! This is for the Question2**
